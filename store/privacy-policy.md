# Privacy Policy — Smart Seek for YouTube TV

*Last updated: February 2026*

## Summary

Smart Seek for YouTube TV does not collect, transmit, or share any personal
data. It stores only your extension preferences in your browser's built-in
sync storage.

## Data stored

The extension stores exactly three values using the browser's `storage.sync` API:

| Key           | Type   | Description                          |
|---------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `seekAmount`  | number | Seek duration in seconds (default 5) |
| `backKey`     | string | Seek-backward key binding            |
| `forwardKey`  | string | Seek-forward key binding             |

These values are stored locally in your browser and are subject to your
browser's own sync settings (e.g. Chrome Sync, Firefox Sync). They are never
sent to any server operated by this extension.
